# AI-Powered-Search

- Domain Specfic Knowledge Combination with
  1. Alternative Labels
  2. Synonyms List
  3. Taxonomies
  4. Ontologies
  5. Knowledge Graphs
- Challenges
  1. Polysemy
  2. Context
  3. Personalization
  4. Query-Specific

### Search Engines
1. Indexing (ingest content)
2. Matching (content matching)
3. Ranking (sort content)
4. Relevance (how well the returned content matches with a query; highest relevance score)

#### Vector Sparsity
1. Sparse Vector: Whose most values are zero
2. Dense Vector: Whose most values are non-zero

### Relevancy Metrics:
1. TF-IDF
   - TF: Number of times given term appears in the document
   - IDF:  log(total number of documents) / number of documents with term) + 1****
2. BM25
   - Leverages TF-IDF mostly but provides more control over how much each additional term occurrence contributes to the score and how much
scores are normalized based on document length.
     
#### Scoring techniques applied to influence relevant scores
1. Geospatial Boosting
2. Date Boosting
3. Popularity Boosting
4. Field Boosting
5. Category Boosting
6. Phrase Boosting
7. Semnantic Boosting

#### Knowledge Graphs
  - Graphs composed of "nodes"(vertices) representing entities and edges representing a relationship with another node.
  - Graphs provide a way to model knowledge and infer new insights by traversing the edges between the nodes.
